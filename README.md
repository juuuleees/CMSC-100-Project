5-10-19, 8:06 PM - added procedures for the database. Not sure how/if we're going to implement friend requests
so I didn't make any procedures for it yet.

5-10-19, 8:17 PM - still have to ask about update procedures so we have very basic ones for now.

5-10-19, 10:37 PM - not sure how we're going to implement removing someone from the friends list so didn't include it for now.

5-10-19, 11:48 PM - controllers and routers not yet complete but initial copies are present.

5-11-19, 1:41 AM - bugs in database fixed, but have not populated data for other tables. Check file contents before sourcing.
